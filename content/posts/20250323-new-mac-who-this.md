I just upgraded my personal laptop from a 2015 Intel MacBook Pro to an M4 Pro MacBook Pro. I wanted to try keep this new laptop as clean as possible, as you can imagine using the same machine for 10 years means you accrue a lot of files, setups, half started projects and the rest.

The goal of this post is to act as a sort of documentation for myself of the things I have setup on it and where possible the reasoning for it.

## Mac System Settings
* Apple ID: Sign in
* Keyboard: key repeat = fast, delay until repeat = short
* Trackpad: 3/4 tracking speed, tap to click, click = light, natural scroll = off
* Finder: Show Library, show hidden files, show path to dir

```
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES
```

* Dock: Hide and show dock, increase size, remove most default apps, align on left of screen.

* Set background to Steins Gate Background I've been using this background since at least 2013 and probably before. If anyone has a higher quality copy of this image please send it on.
